const movieLength = 1000000; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?
//6 variables 

// b) How many function calls are there?
//We have no function called 

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators
//This represent the rest seconds after calculating ho many minutes , as % will give the rest

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?
//Totalminutes will show how many minutes in the movie

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?
//result variable will show the exact film duration in hours, minutes and seconds i prefer calling the variable name movie_duration

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer
//Correct this code will work for all values
